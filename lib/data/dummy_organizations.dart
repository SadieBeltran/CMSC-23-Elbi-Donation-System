I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Japanese language, and I've been involved in numerous english patches of Tales games, and I have over 300 confirmed localizations. I am trained in nuance and slang and I'm the top localizer in the entire Tales of Fandom. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will translate you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with using google translate to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of localizers across twitter and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can localize shikata ga nai in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in japanese language, but I have access to the entire lexicon of the English language and I will use it to its full extent to localize your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" translation was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will localize fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.",

//                 "o be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Tales of Rebirth. The story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of race relations most of the plot will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Veigue's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plot points, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Tales of Rebirth truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Veigue's existential catchphrase \"KUREAAAAAAAAAA,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Masaki Hiramatsu's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.",
